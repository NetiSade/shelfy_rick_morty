# Shelfy mobile Flutter Assignment

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create an
application with 2 screens.
Main screen that will present 25 unique random characters from
the Rick and Morty API and when the user clicks on any one of
them the app should move to the Details screen.
Details screen will display the selected character details with the
relevant location details.

## Requirements

1. The app should be written with architecture in mind using
   Flutter best practices.
2. The Main Screen should present the character name, status
   and image.
3. The Details screen should present character name, status,
   image and the details of the character origin and location.
   For each location present its name, type and dimension.
4. The UI and UX are not set (although you can see an example
   at the end) and this is your opportunity to show your UI /
   Animation skills.
   ● Mind empty fields and loading states.
   ● BONUS: add tests.
